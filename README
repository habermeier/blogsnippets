These are code snippets that are not designed to run and or be
self-sufficient.  They are here as a convienience... so I can point to
examples that I didn't want to in-line into a blog or article.

When I have more time, I might work on converting these into fully
functioning samples, but sometimes doing that makes it harder to just
point to the essential things.
